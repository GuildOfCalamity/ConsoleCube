## ðŸ’» Console - 3D Cube Rotation Demo

![Sample](./ScreenShot.jpg)

This example uses the console window to attempt to draw and animate a 3D object with ASCII characters.
However, in terms of framerate, the Console was never meant to be used as a GDI.
With the advent of Direct2D the API calls still work at their lowest level on the GDI.
This should not be used as an approach to making a game engine; it's for entertainment purposes only.
